Idea
name is celstial exploration 
A space exploration game\
2d
vector graphics

exlpore space and find new planets

space should be randomly genwrated
but there should be a defualt seed that way lots of people can explore the same place

it shouldnt just be celtials objrcts
but henrated in systems

maybe instead of randomly genrated i should make maps based on true space
 how about i sort true data and create maps that are an option mode explore real space since this is a 2d game i will need to increment z and pick a range
 
 the controls for the first space ship should be forward and a boost left/right
 
 i would like randomly gentrated systems
 
 this sytems should contail a ranom anout of stars, planets, dwarf, planets, black holes, super dense dead stars.
 
 i want the game to start of hard the farther you travel the more points you get and you can the make upgrades to you ship that help you go farther
 things.
 
 order of things
 
 work out game mechanice
	genration of celstial bodies
	forces /universe should static at first
	spaceship control
point systems
	upgrades
Graphics
	ships
	upgrades
	celstialbodies
	
initial generation

class celstial objest
	size;
	density;
	location x;
	location y;

	child classes of star plannet moon etc
		childs contain info for graphics and names of planet
		
class universe is an object any a defined cirle of space array of galaxyies
class galaxy an object any a defined cirle of space is an array of solar sytems
class solar systems an object any a defined cirle of space is an array of celstial bodies
so i should work from thw universe down
creat a universe fill the universes space with random ly spaced and sized galxies
fill galaxys with ...
thus wont work i would have to genrate massive maps
i want to genrate stuff as i aproach the things
